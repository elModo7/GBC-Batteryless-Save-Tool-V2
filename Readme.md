# Bootleg one-chip Save Manager v2

This tool allows you to inject and extract save files from bootleg Game Boy carts.

It uses [BennVenn's](https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/) NootNoot.exe and works with more batteryless bootleg carts than my V1 version.


You need AutoHotkey v1 for running the program or just [download the executable](https://github.com/elModo7/GBC-Batteryless-Save-Tool-V2/releases/) from releases section.

> [!NOTE]  
> This tool involves no ROM file sharing, it just reads and injects to your own dumped ROMs.
> Most of the UI was made by ChatGPT because I suck at frontend

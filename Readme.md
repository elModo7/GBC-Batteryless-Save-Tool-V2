# Bootleg one-chip Save Manager v2

This tool allows you to inject and extract save files from bootleg Game Boy carts.

It uses [BennVenn's](https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/) NootNoot.exe and works with more batteryless bootleg carts than my V1 version.

You need AutoHotkey v1 for running the program or just [download the executable](https://github.com/elModo7/GBC-Batteryless-Save-Tool-V2/releases/) from releases section.
